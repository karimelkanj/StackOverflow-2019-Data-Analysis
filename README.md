# StackOverflow-2019-Data-Analysis
The motivation behind this project is basically wanting to know whether someone without a College degree in CS can actually pursue a career as a professional developer. I have used Stack Overflow's 2019 annual survey to analyse its data and provide clear answers to my question. I have also written a blogpost that communicates my findings with everybody hoping that I can encourage someone to become a developer in our struggling times.
Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib
