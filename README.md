## Overview
In this Data Analysis, I have answered one of the most asked questions right now. Can anyone get a job as a data scientist, back end developer, front end developer, machine learning engineer or any other kind of computer related jobs, without a College degree?     

## Introduction 
A special thanks to the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2019, as we will use its dataset to uncover one of the hottest question right now. In our current economic crisis, and in a world where normal jobs cannot be executed in a tradiotional manner, the demand for a flexible remote job has been increasing tremendously. The survey conducted by Stack Overflow covers a wide variety of developer related information. In this notebook, the sections related to developers' educational background will be selected for investigation. In order to provide a ‘Yes or No’ answer to our main question, three sub-questions need to be answered.

### Questions:
1. What makes this survey suitable for analysis?         
2. What educational background do professional developers have?         
3. What is the best route to follow to become a professional developer?        

## Description:
After conducting the analysis, I have came to the following conclusions.
1. The survey is relevant for this investigation because about 75% of all respondents are working professional developers.      
2.
